# High-Performance-Ceramic-Substrates
    Enhancement on both thermal conductivity and bending strength of a ceramic substrate is crucial to its applicability, and optimizing their combination is of a great challenge to ceramic substrate design and preparation for the best performance of ceramic substrates fabricated with different process parameters. Herein, we report the latest study in which thermal conductivity and bending strength of three distinct ceramic substrates (Al2O3, AlN, and Si3N4) are systematically predicted and analyzed using a machine learning (ML) method based on the extreme gradient enhancement method (XGBoost) with further experimental validation.
